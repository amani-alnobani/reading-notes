# SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB
1. What does SQL stand for?
#### Structured Query Language
2. What is a realational database?
#### A relational database is a type of database that stores and provides access to data points that are related to one another.
3. What is a ‘schema’?
#### Definition of schema
1. a diagrammatic presentation
broadly : a structured framework or plan : OUTLINE
2. a mental codification of experience that includes a particular organized way of perceiving cognitively and responding to a complex situation or set of stimuli
4. What is a NoSQL database?
#### NoSQL databases (aka "not only SQL") are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model. The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph. They provide flexible schemas and scale easily with large amounts of data and high user loads.
5. What is inside of a Mongo database?
#### MongoDB stores data records as documents (specifically BSON documents) which are gathered together in collections
6. Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
#### MySQL is a popular, free-to-use, and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Oracle. As with other relational systems, MySQL stores data using tables and rows, enforces referential integrity and uses structured query language (SQL) for data access. When users need to retrieve data from a MySQL database, they must construct an SQL query that joins multiple tables together to create the view on the data they require.
7. What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
#### Disadvantages. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have (basically don't support ACID). This also means that NoSQL databases offer consistency in performance and scalability

| *SQL*      | *noSQL* |
| ----------- | ----------- |
|SQL databases are primarily called as Relational Databases (RDBMS)|NoSQL database are primarily called as non-relational or distributed database|
|SQL databases are table based databases |NoSQL databases are document based, key-value pairs, graph databases or wide-column stores|
|SQL databases have predefined schema |NoSQL databases have dynamic schema for unstructured data|
|SQL databases are vertically scalable|NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable|

1. What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
2. Give a real world example.
3. What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
4. Give a real world example.
5. Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
6. Which type of database is best for scalability?
# SQL Database Examples
1. MySQL Community Edition: MySQL database is very popular open-source database. It is generally been stacked with apache and PHP, although it can be also stacked with nginx and server side javascripting using Node js
2. MS-SQL Server Express Edition: It is a powerful and user friendly database which has good stability, reliability and scalability with support from Microsoft. 
# NoSQL Database Examples
1. MongoDB: Mongodb is one of the most popular document based NoSQL database as it stores data in JSON like documents. It is non-relational database with dynamic schema.
2. CouchDB: CouchDB is also a document based NoSQL database. It stores data in form of JSON documents.

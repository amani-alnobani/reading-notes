# Domain Modeling
#### Domain modeling is the process of creating a conceptual model in code for a specific problem. A model describes the various entities, their attributes and behaviors, as well as the constraints that govern the problem domain. An entity that stores data in properties and encapsulates behaviors in methods is commonly referred to as an object-oriented model.
## Define a constructor and initialize properties
#### To define the same properties between many objects, you'll want to use a constructor function.
#### Here's an implementation of the EpicFailVideo constructor function.
#### var EpicFailVideo = function(epicRating, hasAnimals) {
  #### this.epicRating = epicRating;
  #### this.hasAnimals = hasAnimals;
#### }
#### var parkourFail = new EpicFailVideo(7, false);
#### var corgiFail = new EpicFailVideo(4, true);
#### console.log(parkourFail);
#### console.log(corgiFail);

## Generate random numbers
#### To model the random nature of user behavior, you'll need the help of a random number generator. Fortunately, the JavaScript standard library includes a Math.random() function for just this sort of occasion.

# TABLES
### What's a Table?
#### A table represents information in a grid format.Examples of tables include financial reports, TV schedules, and sports results.
1. Spanning Columns
#### Sometimes you may need the entries in a table to stretch across more than one column. The colspan attribute can be used on a th or td element and indicates how many columns that cell should run across. In the example on the right you can see a timetable with five columns; the first column contains the heading for that row (the day), the remaining four represent one hour time slots.If you look at the table cell that contains the words 'Geography' you will see that the value of the colspan attribute is 2, which indicates that the cell should run across two columns. In the third row, 'Gym' runs across three columns. You can see that the second and third rows have fewer td elements than there are columns. This is because, when a cell extends across more than one column, the td or th cells that would have been in the place of the wider cells are not included in the code. I added some CSS styles to this example so that you can see how the cells span more than one column.
2. Spanning ROWS
#### You may also need entries in a table to stretch down across more than one row. The rowspan attribute can be used on a <th> or <td> element to indicate how many rows a cell should span down the table. In the example on the left you can see that ABC is showing a movie from 6pm - 8pm, whereas the BBC and CNN channels are both showing two programs during this time period (each of which lasts one hour). If you look at the last tr element, it only contains three elements even though there are four columns in the result below. This is because the movie in the tr element above it uses the rowspan attribute to stretch down and take over the cell below. I have added some CSS styles to this example so that you can see how the cells span more than one row.


# OBJECTS
### CREATING OBJECTS:

### RECAP: STORING DATA
#### In JavaScript, data is represented using name/value pairs. To organize your data, you can use an array or object to group a set of related values. In arrays and objects the name is also known as a key.
### WHAT ARE BUILT-IN OBJECTS?
#### Browsers come with a set of built-in objects that represent things like the browser window and the current web page shown in that window. These built-in objects act like a toolkit for creating interactive web pages.
#### JavaScript sports a number of built-in objects that extend the flexibility of the language. These objects are Date, Math, String, Array, and Object. Several of these objects are "borrowed" from the Java language specification, but JavaScript's implementation of them is different. These objects are used for simple data processing in the JavaScript.
1. Math Object
2. Date Object
3. String Object

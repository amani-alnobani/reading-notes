# Layout
## Key Concepts in Positioning Elements
### Building Blocks
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-level box or an inline box.
1. Inline elements: flow in between surrounding text
2. Block-level elements: start on a new line
### Containing Elements
#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
## Controlling the Position of Elements
#### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the position property in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
1. Normal flow
2. Relative Positioning
3. Absolute positioning
4. Fixed Positioning
5. Floating Elements
### position
1. static
2. relative
3. absolute
4. fixed
## Sreen Sizes
#### Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
## Page Sizes
#### Because screen sizes and display resolutions vary so much, web designers often try to create pages of around 960-1000 pixels wide (since most users will be able to see designs this wide on their screens).
### Fixed Width Layouts
#### Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. Measurements tend to be given in pixels
#### Advantages
1. Pixel values are accurate at controlling size and positioning of elements
2. You can control the lengths of lines of text regardless of the size of the user's window
3. The size of an image will always remain the same relative to the rest of the page.
#### Disadvantages
1. You can end up with big gaps around the edge of a page.
2. If the user's screen is a much higher resolution than the designer's screen, the page can look smaller and text can be harder to read.
3. If a user increases font sizes, text might not fit into the allotted spaces.
4.  The design works best on devices that have a site or resolution similar to that of desktop or laptop computers.
5. The page will often take up more vertical space than a liquid layout with the same content.
### Liquid Layouts
### Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser window. They tend to use percentages.

## How the web work
![](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.c1Rghne0yiRULD4wlvP0iwHaD8?pid=ImgDet&rs=1)
#### When you visit a website, the web server hosting that site could be anywhere in the world. In order for you to find the location of the web server, your browser will first connect to a Domain Name System (DNS) server.
## How Pages use Structure:
#### Think about the stories you read in a newspaper: for each story, there will be a headline, some text, and possibly some images. If the  article is a long piece, there may be subheadings that split the story into separate sections or quotes from those involved. Structure helps readers understand the stories in the newspaper.The structure is very similar when a news story is viewed online (although it may also feature audio or video). This is illustrated on the right with a copy of a newspaper alongside the corresponding article on its website.Now think about a very different type of document — an insurance form. Insurance forms often have headings for different sections, and each section contains a list of questions with areas for you to fill in details or checkboxes to tick. Again, the structure is very similar online.
## Html describes the Structure of Pages
#### In the browser window you can see a web page that features exactly the same content as the Word document you met on the page 18. To describe the structure of a web page, we add code to the words we want to appear on the page.
## Attributes tell us more about eLements
#### Attributes provide additional information about the contents of an element. They appear on the opening tag of the element and are made up of two parts: a name and a value, separated by an equals sign.

## Extra Markup
### The Evolution of html
#### Since the web was first created, there have been several different versions of HTML.
1. html4 released 1997
2. xhtml 1.0 released 2000
3. html4 released 2000
#### Because there have been several versions of HTML, each web page should begin with a DOCTYPE declaration to tell a browser which version of HTML the page is using (although browsers usually display the page even if it is not included). 
## HTML5 layout
#### HTML5 is introducing a new set of elements that help define the structure of a page.
1. TraditionaL HTML Layouts: For a long time, web page authors used <div> elements to group together related elements on the page (such as the elements that form a header, an article, footer or sidebar). Authors used class or id attributes to indicate the role of the <div> element in the structure of the page.
2.  New HTML5 Layout eLement: TML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
## process and design
#### Who is the site For? Every website should be designed for the target audience—not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to understand who your target audience is.
## target audience:
1. individuals
2. companies
## A SCRIPT IS A SERIES OF INSTRUCTIONS:
#### A script is  a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal. 
#### To write a script, you need to first state your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in order to achieve it. Start w it h the big picture of what you want to achieve, and break that down into smaller steps:
1.  DEFINE THE GOAL
2. DESIGN THE SCRIPT 
3. CODE EACH STEP
### WHAT IS THE SCRIPT?

#### A  script is a series of instructions that the computer can follow in  order to achieve a goal. Each time the script runs, it might only use a subset of all the instructions. Computers approach tasks in a different way than humans, so your instructions must let the computer solve the task prggrammatically. To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task.

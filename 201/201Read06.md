# WHAT IS AN OBJECT?
#### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.
### IN AN OBJECT: VARIABLES BECOME KNOWN AS PROPERTIES: 
#### If a variable is part of an object, it is called a property. Properties te ll us about the object, such as the name of a hotel or the number of rooms it has. Each individual hotel might have a different name and a different number of rooms.
### IN AN OBJECT: FUNCTIONS BECOME KNOWN AS METHODS:
#### If a function is part of an object, it is called a method. Methods represent tasks that are associated with the object. For example, you can check how many rooms are available by subtracting the number of booked rooms from t he total number of rooms.
# Document Object Model (DOM)
#### The Document Object Model (DOM) specifies how browsers should create a model of an HTML page and how JavaScript can access and update the contents of a web page while it is  in the browser window. 
#### The DOM is neither part of HTML, nor part of JavaScript; it is a separate set of rules. It is implemented by all major browser makers, and covers two primary areas: 
1. MAKING A MODEL OF THE HTML PAGE 
2. ACCESSING AND CHANGING THE HTML PAGE

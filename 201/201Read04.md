# Links
#### Links are the defining feature of the web because they allow you to move from one web page to another â€” enabling the very idea of browsing or surfing

## Writing Links
#### Links are created using the a element. Users can click on anything between the opening a tag and the closing a tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.
### emaiL Links
#### mailto:To create a link that starts up the user's email program and addresses an email to a specified email address, you use the 'a' element. However, this time the value of the href attribute starts with mailto: and is followed by the email address you want the email to be sent to.
# Layout
## Key ConCepts in positioning eLements
### Building Blocks
#### CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its own box. This box will either be a block-levelbox or an inline box.
1. Block-level elementsstart on a new line
2. inline elements flow in Between surrounding text
### containing ElEmEnts
#### If one block-level element sits inside another block-level element then the outer box is known as the containing or parent element.
## ControLLing the position of eLements
#### CSS has the following positioning schemes that allow you to control the layout of a page: normal flow, relative positioning, and absolute positioning. You specify the positioning scheme using the positionproperty in CSS. You can also float elements using the float property.
1. normal flowEvery block-level element appears on a new line, causing each item to appear lower down the page than the previous one. Even if you specify the width of the boxes and there is space for two elements to sit side-by-side, they will not appear next to each other. This is the default behavior (unless you tell the browser to do something else).
2. relative PositioningThis moves an element from the position it would be in normal flow, shifting it to the top, right, bottom, or left of where it would have been placed. This does not affect the position of surrounding elements; they stay in the position they would be in in normal flow.
3. absolute PositioningThis positions the element in relation to its containing element. It is taken out of normal flow, meaning that it does not affect the position of any surrounding elements (as they simply ignore the space it would have taken up). Absolutely positioned elements move as users scroll up and down the page.
4. fixed Positioning This is a form of absolute positioning that positions the element in relation to the browser window, as opposed to the containing element. Elements with fixed positioning do not affect the position of surrounding elements and they do not move when the user scrolls up or down the page.
5. floating elementsFloating an element allows you to take that element out of normal flow and position it to the far left or right of a containing box. The floated element becomes a block-level element around which other content can flow.

# js:
1. FUNCTIONS & OBJECTS BUILT-IN METHODS 
##### Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function (rather than repeating the same set of st atements).
2. OBJECT
##### Objects group together a set of variables and functions to create a model of a something you would recognize from the real world. In an object, variables and functions take on new names.

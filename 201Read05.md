# IMAGES
### Adding Images:
#### To add an image into the page you need to use an imgelement. This is an empty element (which means there is no closing tag). It must carry the following two attributes:
1. src
2. alt
### Where to Place Images in Your Code
#### Where an image is placed in the code will affect how it is displayed. Here are three examples of image placement that produce different results:
1. before a paragraph
2. inside the start of a paragraph
3. in the middle of a paragraph
### Three Rules for Creating Images:
1. Save images in the right format
2. Save images at the right size
3. Use the correct resolution
# Color
### Foreground Color
#### The color property allows you to specify the color of text inside an element. You can specify any color in CSS in one of three ways:
1. rgb values
2. hex codes
3. color names

### Understanding Color
#### Every color on a computer screen is created by mixing amounts of red, green, and blue. To find the color you want, you can use a color picker. Understanding Color Computer monitors are made up of thousands of tiny squares called pixels (if you look very closely at your monitor you should be able to see them). When the screen is not turned on, it's black because it's not emitting any light. When it's on, each pixel can be a different color, creating a picture. The color of every pixel on the screen is expressed in terms of a mix of red, green, and blue â€” just like on a television screen. Color picking tools are available in image editing programs like Photoshop and GIMP. You can see the RGB values specified next to the radio buttons that say R, G, B. The hex

### Typeface Terminology
1. Serif
2. Sans-Serif
3. Monospace
### Specifying Typefaces
#### The font-family property allows you to specify the typeface that should be used for any text inside the element(s) to which a CSS rule applies. The value of this property is the name of the typeface you want to use.

#### The people who are visiting your site need the typeface you have specified installed on their computer in order for it to bE displayed.You can specify a list of fonts separated by commas so that, if the user does not have your first choice of typeface installed, the browser can try to use an alternative font from the list. It is also common to end with a generic font name for that type of font (which you saw on pages 269-270). If a font name is made up of more than one word, it should be put in double quotes. Designers suggest pages usually look better if they use no more than three typefaces on a page. We will be using an extended version of the HTML shown on this page for all of the examples in this chapter.
### Size of TYPE
#### The font-size property enables you to specify a size for the font. There are several ways to specify the size of a font. The most common are:
1. pixels
2. percentages
3. EMS

2. Bold,italic, emphasis
3. Structural and semantic markup

### Heading 
#### HTML has six "levels" of headings: h1 is used for main headings h2 is used for subheadingsIf there are further sections under the subheadings then the <h3> element is used, and so on...Browsers display the contents of headings at different sizes. The contents of an h1 element is the largest, and the contents of an h6 element is the smallest. The exact size at which each browser shows the headings can vary slightly. Users can also adjust the size of text in their browser. You will see how to control the size of text, its color, and the fonts used when we come to look at CSS.
### PARAGRAPHS
#### p To create a paragraph, surround the words that make up the paragraph with an opening p tag and closing p tag.By default, a browser will show each paragraph on a new line with some space between it and any subsequent paragraphs.
### BOLD& ITALIC
#### b By enclosing words in the tags b and b we can make characters appear bold.The b element also represents a section of text that would be presented in a visually different way (for example key words in a paragraph) although the use of the b element does not imply any additional meaning.
#### i By enclosing words in the tags i and i we can make characters appear italic.The i element also represents a section of text that would be said in a different way from surrounding content â€” such as technical terms, names of ships, foreign words, thoughts, or other terms that would usually be italicized.
### STRONG & EMPHASIS
#### strong The use of the strong element indicates that its content has strong importance. For example, the words contained in this element might be said with strong emphasis.By default, browsers will show the contents of a strong element in bold. 
#### em The em  element indicates emphasis that subtly changes the meaning of a sentence.By default browsers will show the contents of an em element in italic.
### SUMMARY:
1. HTML elements are used to describe the structure of Xthe page (e.g. headings, subheadings, paragraphs).
2. They also provide semantic information (e.g. where Xemphasis should be placed, the definition of any acronyms used, when given text is a quotation).

## BASIC JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS
1. STATEMENTS: A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one. Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement. Statements should end with a semicolon. 
2. COMMENT: You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code.

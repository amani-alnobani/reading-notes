# JavaScript
#### JavaScript (JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, or just-in-time compiled programming language with first-class functions. While it is most well-known as the scripting language for Web pages, many non-browser environments also use it, such as Node.js, Apache CouchDB and Adobe Acrobat. JavaScript is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm, single-threaded, dynamic language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and declarative (e.g. functional programming) styles.

  #### JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values. In this example, x, y, and z, are variables, declared with the var keyword:

  ## JavaScript Identifiers: 
  #### he general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:
  1. Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.
  2. Names must begin with a letter
  3. Names can also begin with $ and _ (but we will not use it in this tutorial)
  4. Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables)
  5. Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names 
## How Computers Work? 
#### A computer is a machine composed of hardware and software components. A computer receives data through an input unit based on the instructions it is given and after it processes the data, it sends it back through an output device.

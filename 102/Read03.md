# Wireframing  
## An introduction to wireframing  
#### Wireframing is a practice used by UX designers which allows them to define and plan the information hierarchy of their design for a website, app, or product. This process focuses on how the designer or client wants the user to process information on a site, based on the user research already performed by the UX design team.

# HTML basics
#### HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables. As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

## The main parts of our element are as follows
1. The opening tag
2. The closing tag
3. The content
4. The element

# Semantics
#### In programming, Semantics refers to the meaning of a piece of code â€” for example "what effect does running that line of JavaScript have?", or "what purpose or role does that HTML element have" (rather than "what does it look like?".)

## Semantic elements
### These are some of the roughly 100 semantic elements available **for example**:

1. *<article>*
2. *<aside>*
3. *<details>*
4. *<figcaption>*
5. *<figure>*
6. *<footer>*

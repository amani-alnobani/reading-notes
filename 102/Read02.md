# introduction 
### Before beginning this tutorial, it is highly recommended that you have a solid understanding of the Terminal (for Mac) or Command Line (for Windows and Linux).
In order to explain Git, we have to first explain various aspects of Version Control.
# Version Control:
1. Local Version Control  
2. Centralized Version Control  
3. Distributed Version Control  


# what is Git?
### Git is a DVCS that stores data in a file system made up of snapshots. Each time you save a changed version of your project — called commit — Git creates a snapshot of the file and stores a reference to it. If the file has not changed, Git only stores a reference to the already-stored identical version of it.
